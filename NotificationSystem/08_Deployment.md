# Notification System Deployment Plan
This document will provide the deployment plan design for the notification system. 

## Deployment Process
### Development Environment Setup
* Create the environment for the notification system including tools and frameworks.
* Install the relevant IDEâ€™s and programming languages.
* Set up the appropriate libraries.
* Configure the environment variables and credentials.

### Continuous Integration (CI)
* Create the continuous integration (CI) pipeline to automate testing.
* Configure the CI service in GitHub actions on every pull request.
* Run all the different types of tests on the system.

### Staging Environment
* Deploy the notification system to a temporary copy of the application.
* Deploy the notification system to the staging environment using the CI pipeline.
* Perform the various tests to the system.

### Production Deployment
* Deploy the notification system to the actual environment after testing in the temporary copy.
* Deploy the notification system to the production environment using the CI pipeline.
* Monitor the system's logs and reports.

## Best Practices
* Use Version Control - to track changes to the code.
* Automate Deployment - CI pipeline to automate the testing.
* Monitor Performance - logs, and error reports to identify and address issues.

## Next Steps
* Set up a CI pipeline.
* Deploy the notification system to a temporary environment for testing.
* Deploy the notification system to the actual environment.
* Monitor the system's performance logs and error reports and fix any errors.
